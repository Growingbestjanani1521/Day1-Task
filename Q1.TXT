Write a blog on Difference between HTTP1.1 vs HTTP2

HTTP/1.1:

Multiplexing: No multiplexing. One request per connection.

Header Compression: Headers are not compressed, leading to higher overhead.

Request Prioritization: No built-in support for request prioritization.

Server Push: No native server push support.

Binary Protocol: Text-based protocol, making it human-readable but less efficient.

Persistent Connections: Connections are not persistent by default, leading to the overhead of repeatedly establishing connections.

HTTP2:

Multiplexing: Multiplexing allows multiple requests and responses to be sent in parallel over a single connection.

Header Compression: Efficient header compression (HPACK) significantly reduces header size, improving performance.

Request Prioritization: Supports request prioritization, allowing the client to specify the importance of different resources.

Server Push: Server push enables the server to send additional resources to the client before they are requested.

Binary Protocol: Binary protocol for faster parsing and reduced complexity in data transfer.

Persistent Connections: Persistent connections are the default, reducing latency by reusing the same connection for multiple requests.
